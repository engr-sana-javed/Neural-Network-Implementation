# Nueral-Network-implementation
This project is about the implementation of neural network by using MNIST Handwritten Digits data set.It will predict handwritten digits using 
Keras.
## Data set
In this project data set is images of handwritten digits from various resources.Each image is a 28x28 pixel square. This data set is already available in keras.datasets.
further, this data set consists of both training and test data.

## Model 
Neural network having 1 hidden layer with relu activation function has implemented. After that, model is trained by using training data set after that it is evaluated by using test data.

## Conclusion
Finally, a machine learning model is trained by  using a prebuilt dataset using the Keras API.
