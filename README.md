# Neural-Network-Implementation
This project is about the implementation of a neural network by using the MNIST Handwritten Digits data set. It will predict handwritten digits using 
Keras.
## Data set
In this project data set is images of handwritten digits from various resources. Each image is a 28x28 pixel square. This data set is already available in Keras. datasets.
further, this data set consists of both training and test data.

## Model 
A neural network having 1 hidden layer with relu activation function has been implemented. Further, the model is trained using training data set and then evaluated using test data.

## Conclusion
Finally, a machine learning model is trained using a prebuilt dataset using the Keras API.
